# Superchat

This project taught me a lot about handling client and back-end interactions. Consisting of two pages, the signup form and the main chat window, superchat was custom designed and developed to accomplish the main criteria of users being able to go through a login process and interact with each other.

Being a group chat, the user first needs to create an account, either with email and password, or with their google account. After signing in, the user can send messages to the group chat using the form below, see other user messages, with a logout button on the top right
